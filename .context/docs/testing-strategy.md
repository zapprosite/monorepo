## Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for maintaining code quality.

**Testing Philosophy**:
- Tests should be fast, isolated, and deterministic
- Follow the test pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Every bug fix should include a regression test

## Test Types

**Unit Tests**:
- Framework: Jest / Vitest
- Location: `__tests__/` or co-located `*.test.ts` files
- Purpose: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Mocking: Use jest mocks for external dependencies

**Integration Tests**:
- Framework: Jest / Vitest
- Location: `tests/integration/` or `*.integration.test.ts`
- Purpose: Test feature workflows and component interactions
- Setup: May require test database or external services

**E2E Tests** (if applicable):
- Framework: Playwright / Cypress
- Location: `e2e/` or `tests/e2e/`
- Purpose: Test critical user paths end-to-end
- Environment: Requires full application stack

## Running Tests

**Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- path/to/file.test.ts

# Run tests matching pattern
npm run test -- --testNamePattern="pattern"
```

## Quality Gates

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum overall coverage: 80%
- New code should have higher coverage
- Critical paths require 100% coverage

**Pre-merge Checks**:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage thresholds met
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)

**CI Pipeline**:
- Tests run automatically on every PR
- Coverage reports generated and compared to baseline
- Failed checks block merge

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

*Tests timing out*:
- Increase timeout for slow operations
- Check for unresolved promises
- Verify mocks are properly configured

*Flaky tests*:
- Avoid time-dependent assertions
- Use proper async/await patterns
- Isolate tests from external state

*Environment issues*:
- Ensure Node version matches project requirements
- Clear node_modules and reinstall if dependencies are corrupted
- Check for conflicting global installations
