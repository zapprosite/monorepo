## Security & Compliance Notes

This document outlines security practices, policies, and guidelines for this project.

**Security Principles**:
- Defense in depth — Multiple security layers
- Principle of least privilege — Minimal necessary access
- Secure by default — Safe configurations out of the box

## Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication**:
- [Describe authentication mechanism: JWT, sessions, OAuth, etc.]
- Token/session expiration: [Duration]
- Refresh strategy: [How tokens are refreshed]

**Authorization**:
- Permission model: [RBAC, ABAC, etc.]
- Role definitions: [Admin, User, etc.]

**Best Practices**:
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Audit access to sensitive data

## Compliance & Policies

**Applicable Standards**:
- [List relevant compliance frameworks]

**Security Policies**:
- Code review required for all changes
- Dependency scanning for vulnerabilities
- Regular security assessments

## Incident Response

**Reporting Security Issues**:
- Report security vulnerabilities to [security contact]
- Do not disclose publicly before fix is available

**Incident Response**:
