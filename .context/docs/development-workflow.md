## Development Workflow

This document outlines the day-to-day engineering process for contributing to this repository.

Following these guidelines ensures consistent code quality and smooth collaboration across the team.

## Branching & Releases

**Branching Model**: Feature branches off `main`

- `main` — Production-ready code, always deployable
- `feature/*` — New features and enhancements
- `fix/*` — Bug fixes
- `chore/*` — Maintenance and tooling updates

**Release Process**:
1. Features are developed in branches
2. PRs require review and passing CI
3. Merged PRs are deployed automatically (or tagged for release)

**Versioning**: Semantic versioning (semver) - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## Local Development

**Setup**:
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

**Daily Commands**:
- `npm run dev` — Start development server/watch mode
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run test` — Run test suite
- `npm run lint` — Check code style

**Before Committing**:
```bash
npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build
```

## Code Review Expectations

**PR Requirements**:
- Clear description of changes and motivation
- Tests for new functionality
- Documentation updates for API changes
- Passing CI checks

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests cover the changes adequately
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions

**Approval**: At least one approving review required before merge.

See [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for AI assistant collaboration guidelines.

## Onboarding Tasks

**First Steps for New Contributors**:
1. Read the [Project Overview](./project-overview.md)
2. Set up local development environment
3. Run the test suite to verify setup
4. Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
